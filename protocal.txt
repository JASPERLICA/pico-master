1. Data Packages from Master Board to Computer (JSON format):
There are three types of data packages that the master board sends to the computer:

Photoeye State:

{"Photoeye":"ON"} → Indicates that the photoelectric sensor is triggered (ON).
{"Photoeye":"OFF"} → Indicates that the photoelectric sensor is not triggered (OFF).
Status Report:

{"Status": data} → A status message that sends 8 bits of data, where each bit represents the state of a different component of the system.
8-bit Status Data:
Each bit in the status byte corresponds to a specific system state as follows:

Bit     Position	Component	Bit Value	Description
Bit 7	Photoeye	b'10000000'	Photoeye state (ON=1, OFF=0)
Bit 6	Computer	b'01000000'	Computer running (ON=1, OFF=0)
Bit 5	POE Switch	b'00100000'	POE switch status
Bit 4	Fun	        b'00010000'	Fan status (ON=1, OFF=0)
Bit 3	Channel 0	b'00001000'	Channel 0 LED panel status
Bit 2	Channel 1	b'00000100'	Channel 1 LED panel status
Bit 1	Channel 2	b'00000010'	Channel 2 LED panel status
Bit 0	Channel 3	b'00000001'	Channel 3 LED panel status
2. Commands from Computer to Master Board:
The computer sends specific commands to control the system components. Each command is a string that triggers an action on the master board. Here are the available commands:

System Control Commands:
"ALIVE": Indicates that the computer is running properly (must be sent at least every 30 seconds).
"RESET": Resets the entire system.
Power and Channel Control Commands:
"ALL ON": Turns all LED panels on.
"ALL OFF": Turns all LED panels off.
Individual Channel Control:
"CHANNEL0_ON": Turns Channel 0 LED panel on.
"CHANNEL0_OFF": Turns Channel 0 LED panel off.
"CHANNEL1_ON": Turns Channel 1 LED panel on.
"CHANNEL1_OFF": Turns Channel 1 LED panel off.
"CHANNEL2_ON": Turns Channel 2 LED panel on.
"CHANNEL2_OFF": Turns Channel 2 LED panel off.
"CHANNEL3_ON": Turns Channel 3 LED panel on.
"CHANNEL3_OFF": Turns Channel 3 LED panel off.
POE and NUC Control:
"POE RESET": Resets the POE (Power over Ethernet) network switch.
"NUC RESET": Resets the NUC computer power.
Fan Control:
"FUN ON": Turns the fan on.
"FUN OFF": Turns the fan off.
LED Brightness Control:
"LED_BRIGHTER": Increases LED panel brightness.
"LED_DIM": Decreases LED panel brightness.
